# Changelog

All notable changes to the Nexus project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Documentation Updates**
  - Comprehensive scripts documentation in SCRIPTS.md
  - Updated README with accurate implementation details
  - Corrected testing documentation to reflect Vitest usage
  - Enhanced contributing guidelines with cross-platform support
- Persistent multi-chat support with new `SessionSidebar` (create/switch/rename/pin/delete chats).
- Auto-session renaming, session pruning utilities, clear history button.
- Neutral waiting indicator while awaiting LLM responses.

### Changed
- **Test Framework Migration**
  - Fully migrated from Jest to Vitest for better ES module support
  - Removed legacy jest.config.js file
  - Updated all test documentation and examples
- Branding updated from "Nexus MVP" to "Nexus".
- Chat set as default primary tab; Dashboard moved after Chat.
- Removed obsolete MCP server sidebar component.

### Fixed
- **Documentation Accuracy**
  - Corrected state management description (Zustand + React Context)
  - Updated available scripts list to match package.json
  - Fixed test framework references throughout documentation
  - Added known issues section for EPIPE errors and WSL compatibility

### Planned
- Multiple chat sessions/tabs
- MCP marketplace integration
- Auto-discovery of local MCP servers
- Workspace/project management features
- Advanced debugging and analytics
- Plugin system for custom integrations

### MCP Server Shutdown
  - Added graceful shutdown and error-listener logic in `src/main/mcp/ConnectionManager.ts` to prevent Nexus from crashing with `EPIPE: broken pipe` when stopping STDIO servers.  The underlying MCP child process may still print an EPIPE stack-trace, but this is now confirmed to be **cosmetic** and has no impact on Nexus stability.
